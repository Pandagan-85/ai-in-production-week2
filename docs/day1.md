# ✅ Day 1: Introducing The Twin

## What Was Built

A **full-stack AI chat application** running locally that demonstrates the importance of conversation memory:

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Modern React chat interface with Tailwind CSS styling
- Real-time message display with user/assistant differentiation
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Loading animation while waiting for responses
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for multiline)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Backend (FastAPI)
- RESTful API with session-based memory management
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- CORS configuration for development
- Health check endpoints
- Three main endpoints:
  - `GET /` - Root endpoint
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `POST /chat` - Chat endpoint with message and session_id
  - `GET /sessions` - List all conversation sessions

### Memory System
- File-based JSON storage for conversation history
- Each session gets a unique UUID identifier
- Messages persist across server restarts
- System personality injected from `backend/me.txt`

## Key Learning: Why Memory Matters

**The Problem**: Without memory, each AI interaction feels disconnected and frustrating. The twin doesn't remember what you just told it.

**The Solution**: Store conversation history and include it as context for each new request. This creates natural, continuous conversations.

## Tech Stack (Day 1)

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15 + React 19 | Modern web framework with SSR |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first CSS framework |
| **Icons** | lucide-react | Beautiful icon library |
| **Backend** | FastAPI | High-performance Python API framework |
| **AI** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Language model for responses |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.13 | Backend runtime |
| **Package Mgr** | uv | Fast Python package manager |
| **Storage** | Local Files | JSON-based memory persistence |

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 20+
- OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
uv add -r requirements.txt

# Create .env file with your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
echo "CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000" >> .env

# Start the server
uv run uvicorn server:app --reload
```

Server runs at: `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Tailwind CSS styling library
npm install lucide-react

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing the Application

1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Start a conversation:
   - **Message 1**: "Hi! My name is Alex and I love Python"
   - **Twin Response**: Greets you with enthusiasm
   - **Message 2**: "What's my name and what do I love?"
   - **Expected Result**: Twin remembers your name is Alex and you love Python! ✨

3. Refresh the page and send a new message:
   - **Message 3**: "Do you remember my name?"
   - **Expected Result**: Twin still remembers from previous session!

## Key Observations

Building this was interesting because it immediately became clear how critical memory is. The twin is useless without it - conversations feel disjointed and frustrating. This is the foundation for everything that comes next.

The separation of concerns between frontend and backend works well. Having TypeScript on the frontend and type hints in FastAPI catches a lot of issues early.

## API Endpoints Reference

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Get all sessions
curl http://localhost:8000/sessions

# Send a chat message
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello!",
    "session_id": "optional-uuid"
  }'
```

## Memory Storage Format

Each conversation is stored as `memory/{session_id}.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hi! My name is Alex",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-21T10:30:00"
  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Hello Alex! Nice to meet you...",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-21T10:30:05"
  }
]
```

## What's Next

Day 2 moves this to AWS cloud - packaging the backend for Lambda, setting up S3 for storage, and distributing everything through CloudFront. This is when things get real.
